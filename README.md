# Diabetes Classification Using Decision Tree

## Project Description

This project focuses on building a **machine learning classification model** to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health metrics.  
The dataset used is the **Diabetes Dataset** from Scikit-learn, which contains features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and more. The analysis aims to provide insights into factors contributing to diabetes and build an interpretable classification model using a **Decision Tree Classifier**.

Link dataset for this project:  
[Scikit-learn Diabetes Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html)

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.  
Analyzing diabetes data can help in identifying individuals at risk and provide actionable insights for preventive measures.

The classification focuses on converting the dataset’s numerical target into a binary target (0 for “No Diabetes,” 1 for “Diabetes”), based on whether the target value exceeds the dataset's mean.

## Goals

1. **Visualize Features**: Analyze and interpret health metrics that affect diabetes.
2. **Classification**: Use a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict diabetes.
3. **Tree Visualization**: Create an interpretable visual representation of the decision-making process.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy in making predictions on unseen data.

## Insights

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - The most influential features in the classification process include BMI and blood pressure.

2. **Model Accuracy**:
   - The model achieved an **accuracy of 72.67%**, indicating reasonable performance for binary classification.

3. **Tree Visualization**:
   - The decision tree structure shows the thresholds used to split data, providing a clear understanding of how predictions are made.

4. **Sample Prediction**:
   - Example: A test sample was classified as "Diabetes," confirming the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.

## Advices

1. **Model Tuning**:
   - Adjust hyperparameters like `max_depth` or `criterion` to enhance prediction performance.
   - Explore alternative classification algorithms like Random Forest for improved accuracy.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Adding domain-specific features, such as family history or physical activity levels, could improve the model.

3. **Dataset Expansion**:
   - Incorporating more data or diverse samples can enhance generalization to real-world cases.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Decision tree visualization provides a starting point for understanding how features influence outcomes, making the model suitable for interpretability-focused applications.
